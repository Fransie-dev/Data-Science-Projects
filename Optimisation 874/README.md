# Optimisation 874
This module was presented with the purpose of understanding the different classes of optimisation problems and implementing advanced optimisation
algorithms to solve real-world optimisation problems. A wide range of advanced metaheuristic optimisation paradigms and algorithms were considered, especially those relevant to data analytics and machine learning.
