## Post-Block Assignment 3

This assignment focussed on constructing and implementing a meta-optimisation algorithm with a high- and low-level particle swarm optimisationa algorithm, after which a high-level relay hybridisation approach was used to improve the meta-optimisation algorithm. A final mark of 100% was achieved for this assignment.
